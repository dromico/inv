  - Admin users should redirect to admin dashboard after login
  - Subcontractors should redirect to subcontractor dashboard after login

### Admin User Creation & Management
- Create initial admin user through Supabase SQL queries during setup
- Implement script or admin panel to add additional admin users if needed
- Admin credentials should be securely stored
- Add proper SQL schema with special flags for admin users
